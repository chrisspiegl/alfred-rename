> [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com) workflow to rename files and folders via your clipboard

<img src="media/screenshot.png" style="width: 100%;">

Add prefix, postfix, and replace `{replace}` strings inside of file and folder names easily.

## Install

```bash
npm install --global alfred-rename
```

*Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 14+ and the Alfred [Powerpack](https://alfredapp.com/powerpack/).*

## Usage

*Careful: the file rename actions can not be reversed!*

If you want to test if you like the result of the workflow, duplicate the files and folders!

* Copy a simple text (one line only) into the clipboard
* Invoke the Alfred File Browser on one or multiple files / folders
* Select `Rename File(s) via Clipboard` action and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
* You will be presented with multiple options to place your clipboard content
* When hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> you will copy the new file names into clipboard
  * This is for the purpose of previewing the change.
  * To then actually do the change, you will have to copy your initial text element againâ€¦
* To actually make the rename happen, hold down <kbd>Command</kbd> and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
  * The files will be renamed based on your selection

### Replace Variable

If you are using a lot of template files and you would like to place a certain text element into them, you can do the following:

* Create your files
* Put `{replace}` into the filename at the place where you want the other text to go
* Now copy something into your clipboard (like a project name)
* Select the files, and run the `Rename File(s) via Clipboard` action
* Then select the `Replace Variable with Clipboard` action
* Hold down <kbd>Command</kbd> and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to replace the variable in the selected files
